Catnip is a SQL client meant to be as feature complete as possible, while trying to preserve a modern an intuitive UI.
This application is currently under development and not yet ready for use.

There are however a couple of features implemented:
- Connection Management (Add/Edit/Delete connections)
    - SQLite
    - MySQL (allows SSH)
- Table View - allows viewing tables
- Query Editor View (using Monaco editor) - allows running queries (errors not shown)
- 2 available themes (Dark / Skyblue)
- Settings panel to control how the app looks and behaves
